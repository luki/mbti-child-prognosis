# MBTI Child Prognosis

## Introduction
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, as acronym 'MBTI', is a test that 
categorizes one in one of 16 possible personality types.

This project focuses on creating an algorithm to estimate the 
personality type of a child through the parents' results.

## Purpose of this project
### Personal
When I shared a specific free online adaptation of a MBTI test at a party, it
gained popularity. Even a day later, people started to share their results on
Twitter. 
After a while, I came up with this idea.

### Technical
I saw value in working on this, since I haven't worked on practical examples
for machine learning.
